I try to follow the original desing as much as possible, with some licenses:

- It's 10mm short, to fit in a 10x10cm, that is a lot cheaps if order PCB.
- The 7805 regulator board and the output Jack was modify.
- There are some jumper to allow a future ACB stereo mix.
- I use a electrolitic capacitor instead the original tanalo one.

Rom is no available until have a clear idea of it's copyright.

I test with Rom version 1.10, work, but superbasic command play seen to be erratic an
sometimes work and other, the same command do not work.

There is no software available for this card (as far as I know)

You can use a 2764 eprom or a 27F512 that is much more cheap and easy to use.
